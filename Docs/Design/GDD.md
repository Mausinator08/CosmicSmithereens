## Overview

___

## Project scope

- Budget: $0.00 (for now)
- Timeline: TBD

## Elevator Pitch

*This is just an example asteroids like game which will be made along with MGK Framework, and eventually MGK Edit, to showcase the functionality and usability of MGK Framework and MGKEdit for creating games.*

## Monetization

*No monetization for this project.*

## Story

*No story. Just jump in, blast asteroids (and the occasional alien ship) to get the highest score!*

------

## Gameplay

Keep playing through levels with more asteroids each level until all lives are lost and get the highest score. Carefully move and turn your ship around the screen. Fire your cannon rounds at asteroids to break them into smaller asteroids in every level. Eventually the asteroids will be too small to break apart further and just crumble to dust. Do **<u>*NOT*</u>** run into the asteroids! You will die and lose one life. Each level, sometimes an alien ship flies across the screen and fires at you one time. Avoid getting hit by the alien ship’s laser or you will die and lose one life. Run into the alien ship and you will die and lose one life, but the alien ship dies as well.

### Core Game Mechanic #1 (Ship Control Behavior)
